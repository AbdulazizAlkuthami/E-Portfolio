    <p class="section-content">
      As an enthusiastic student at the University of Central Florida, I am engaged in a unique educational path combining Linguistics and Computational Sciences. This special blend reflects my interest in exploring different fields and understanding the intersection of technology and language.
    </p>
    <p class="section-content">
        I take great pride in achieving the CompTIA A+ certification, a testament to my foundational knowledge in cybersecurity and information technology. This achievement, coupled with my proficiency in Java and Python, underscores my technical acumen and readiness to engage with complex digital landscapes. 
      </p>
      <p class="section-content">
        In addition to my technical skills, my studies in Linguistics have honed my abilities as a prolific writer and communicator, enabling me to articulate complex ideas with clarity and precision. This skill is further complemented by my analytical capabilities developed through my Computational Sciences track, making me a well-rounded problem solver.
      </p>
      <p class="section-content">
        Being recognized on both the Dean’s and President’s lists stands as a testament to my academic dedication and my belief in delivering my best in every task and assignment. My goal is to leverage these skills and experiences in the dynamic field of financial technology. I aspire to either contribute significantly to an existing fintech company or to lay the groundwork for an innovative venture in this sector.
      </p>
      <p class="section-content">
        In every endeavor, I bring a commitment to excellence and a strong belief in the power of effectively combining technology and language. I envision a career where I can not only apply my interdisciplinary knowledge but also drive progress in the evolving intersection of finance and technology.

        <h2 class="section-header">Statement of Interdisciplinary Understanding</h2>
        <p class="section-content">
            Before taking the IDS 3933, I thought interdisciplinary studies were about mixing different subjects to achieve a bigger goal. I also believed it was a major for people who wanted to learn about more than one thing and not be limited to a single field of studies.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
            This course has really opened my eyes. At first, I thought interdisciplinary was just about putting different topics together. But now I understand that there's more to it. There's interdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and transdisciplinary, each with its own way of combining subjects.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
            My understanding of this has changed the way I see my future. I'm focused on writing and technology, and I want to use what I've learned in these areas to become good at working with technology, hopefully at a big tech company. I currently have a friend who has told me they've been working on writing a manual for future employees to go by when using a company software, and I think I could combine my two areas of concetration and do the same for the future companies I will work for. I also plan to do this by combining my studies with extra things like certifications and bootcamps.
        </p>
        <p class="section-content">
            In summary, this course taught me that interdisciplinary studies are not just about studying different subjects together. It's about how these subjects can work together in a useful way. I plan to use my writing and tech skills together in my future job, and I think this will make me better at what I do.
