    <p class="statement-content">
      [As an enthusiastic student at the University of Central Florida, I am engaged in a unique educational path, combining Linguistics and Computational Sciences in my Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies. This special blend reflects my interest in exploring different fields and my eagerness to understand the intersection of technology and language.

      I take great pride in achieving the CompTIA A+ certification, which showcases my understanding of cybersecurity and IT basics. This, along with my skills in Java and Python, highlights my technical abilities and readiness to tackle challenges in the digital world.
      
      My linguistic studies have sharpened my writing and communication skills, allowing me to express complex ideas clearly and effectively. These skills are complemented by the problem-solving abilities I've developed through my Computational Sciences coursework, making me a well-equipped and versatile thinker.
      
      Being honored on both the Dean’s and President’s lists is a recognition of my academic commitment and my approach to always give my best in every task. My ambition is to make a significant impact in the fintech sector, either by contributing to an established company or by creating a new venture in this exciting field.
      
      In every project I undertake, I am committed to excellence and firmly believe in the power of combining technology and language effectively. My goal is to apply my diverse knowledge to advance innovation at the crossroads of finance and technology.
